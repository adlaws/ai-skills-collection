# Imperium Docker Bench Expert

Specialised skill for understanding, configuring, running, and troubleshooting the AMT Docker Bench within the Imperium FMS local development environment. This skill combines domain knowledge from the `imperium-expert`, `docker-expert`, and `docker-bench-expert` skills, focused specifically on how Docker Bench integrates with Imperium's tooling and services.

## When to Use This Skill

* User asks about running Docker Bench assets in Imperium's local environment
* User asks about `startAssetDockerBench.ps1`, `startAsset.ps1 -useDockerBench`, or `stopAssetDockerBench.ps1`
* User has networking issues between Docker Bench containers and FMS services
* User asks about `.env-asset-AHT001-docker-bench`, `.env-asset-AHT002-docker-bench`, or asset-docker-compose files
* User wants to understand how the Docker Bench containers communicate with FMS Core services
* User asks about diagnosing Docker Bench assets (`diagnoseAssetDockerBench.ps1`)
* User asks about running the Eliwana crusher test with Docker Bench
* User needs to understand the network topology when Docker Bench runs alongside FMS services
* User asks about DDS, CIC, RPK, or T264 Sim configuration in the Imperium context
* User wants to understand the relationship between `assets.json` and Docker Bench networking

## Adjusting Detail Level

Match the explanation depth to the user's request:

* **Non-technical**: What Docker Bench does, why it exists, what problem it solves for FMS development
* **Overview**: How the containers map to truck hardware, how they connect to FMS services
* **Technical**: Network topology, port mappings, environment variables, startup scripts
* **Deep technical**: NAT rules, DDS participant IDs, IP remapping, iptables verification, mode change orchestration

## How Docker Bench Fits into Imperium

### The Big Picture

Imperium's local development environment (in `Tools/local-environment/`) runs the entire FMS as Docker containers: SQL Server, Redis, RabbitMQ, 40+ FMS Core services, Office, and Field. Docker Bench adds a realistic simulation of the T264 autonomous haul truck's onboard computers to this environment, enabling end-to-end testing of the full autonomous haul cycle without physical hardware.

### Without Docker Bench

FMS developers typically use Robot Simulator (a lightweight .NET service) to simulate autonomous assets. Robot Simulator is fast and simple but does not run the real onboard software.

### With Docker Bench

Docker Bench runs the actual AMT (Autonomy Management Toolkit), CIC (Control IC), and RPK (Robot Perception Kernel) software inside containers, providing production-like fidelity for testing FMS interaction with the truck's onboard systems.
